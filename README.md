# Project Title: Personal Budget

## Description:

This project is a personal budget tracking application built Using Node.js and Express.js. The main purpose of this project is to assist users in managing their personal finances by providing a platform to create spending categories and allocate budgets for each category. Users can then track their spending by updating the amount they have spent in each category. The application also allows users to add transactions and the app will automatically subtract that transaction amount from the allocated budget, helping users stay within their budget and make informed financial decisions. This project is based on the Envelope Budgeting system, which is a popular budgeting method that helps users manage their money more effectively.
